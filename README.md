# Managing folders and yaml files using python and robot framework
Description of python and robot framwork work gig. Only basic details are included.
This work describes the following:
- creation and manuevering folders and subfolders using python
- managing of files in folders in python
- managing, copying, editing, reading and writing of files in folders using python
- Nesting and use of function pointers in python
- Robotframework is used to test the code.

Function pointer in Python are used to reduce deep nesting. In addition, the use of Function Pointers enhances speed thence saving time. Here is a classical example of usage of Function Pointers in Python
Config_1.py uses deep nesting using the if loop. This time consuming during execution and not easy to debug. 
Config_2.py uses Function pointers in Python. It executes within a short time and easy to debug
